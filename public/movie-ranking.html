<h3>Vivre sa Vie</h3>

<p>My favorite movie from the french third-wave era. Philosophical. </p>

<h3>Marie Antoinette</h3>

<p>One of the most visually stunning movies ever. Every shoot could be a painting.</p>

<h3>Wild at Heart</h3>

<p>A ridiculous and disgusting movie by my favorite director David Lynch.</p>
